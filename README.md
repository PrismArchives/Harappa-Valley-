## 🕵️ The Mystery
4,000 years ago, the Indus Valley Civilization built massive cities, standardized weights, and mass-produced millions of tiny, mysterious tablets. But unlike Egypt or Mesopotamia, **nobody knows how to read their writing.**

Historians have spent a century trying to turn these symbols into *words*.
**We are treating them like a Code.**

**Harappa Valley** is a digital logic engine that lets you reverse-engineer the "Source Code" of the Bronze Age. We use real archaeological data to test if you can build a valid administrative receipt.

## 🎮 How It Works (The Protocol)

Think of the Indus Script like a **Barcode** or an **Operating System**. It has rigid rules. If you break the rules, the transaction fails.

Your goal is to arrange the signs to create a **Valid Protocol Sequence**.

### 🧩 The Game Pieces
These aren't just doodles; they are functional operators.

| The Sign | The Name | The Function |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Start Button** | **The Marked Jar (Alpha)**<br>*(Sign 343)* | **INPUT:** Use this to start a new batch. It tells the system "Data incoming." |
| **Stop Button** | **The Jar (Omega)**<br>*(Sign 342)* | **OUTPUT:** The official seal. You **MUST** place this at the end to close the transaction. |
| **The Variable** | **The Fish**<br>*(Sign 59)* | **DATA:** Represents the commodity (Grain? Star position? Season?). This is the "Payload." |
| **The Counter** | **The Stroke**<br>*(Sign 905)* | **QUANTITY:** Simple math. `||` = 2, `|||` = 3. |
| **The Switch** | **The Marker**<br>*(Sign 99)* | **OPERATOR:** A "U-Turn" sign. If you see this, the reading direction reverses! |

## 🛠️ The Challenge

The **ISAPA Engine** (Indus Script Administrative Protocol Analyzer) runs in the background. It checks your work against the statistical laws found on the famous **22 Prismatic Tablets**.

### ✅ Valid Sequence (Green Light)
* **Input:** `[Fish] -> [Stroke] -> [Jar]`
* **Logic:** "Commodity (Fish) + Quantity (1) + Sealed (Jar)."
* **Result:** **VALID_RECEIPT**

### ❌ Invalid Sequence (Red Light)
* **Input:** `[Jar] -> [Fish] -> [Stroke]`
* **Logic:** You put the seal at the beginning! The jar is closed before you put anything in it.
* **Result:** **PROTOCOL_VIOLATION**

## 🧪 The Science Behind the Game
This isn't made up. This is based on rigorous computational archaeology.

* **Standardization:** Based on the work of **J.M. Kenoyer**, proving Harappan weights were binary and standardized.
* **Grid Logic:** Based on **B.K. Wells**, proving signs have fixed "slots" (Prefix/Core/Suffix).
* **Anisotropy:** Based on **M.V. Bhaskar**, identifying signs that act as directional switches.

**We don't claim to know what the signs *sound* like. We measure how they *behave*.**
